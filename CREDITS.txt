CORE CONCEPT INSPIRATION
------------------------
KidsCanCode YouTube channel (2015 tutorial)
https://www.youtube.com/c/Kidscancode

Note: This project's core game concept was inspired by a 9-year-old
KidsCanCode tutorial that I followed 2 years ago. The current codebase
represents a complete from-scratch rewrite with custom architecture,
state management, menu systems, boss battles, and significant feature
additions that substantially deviate from the original tutorial.
